Desktop live objection detection with yolov3

This is my first Github commit. Based on my recent lessons on Yolov3, I attempted to extend the power of Yolov3 from detecting pre-defined objects from still images / videos, to computer desktop display. This tool is more versatile as users can pull up different items on screen, browser various webpages, and see the object detection acting in live environment.

I have to note that at my workstation setup, I have my laptop and x2 slave screens. Therefore it is easy enough for me to open up various items on one screen, while another pop-up window displays on a second screen where Yolov3 object detection takes place.

It is only the first attempt of extending Yolov3's application, and the main intention comes from my workplace inspiration that when I need to explain an idea to my audience, it will help elaborate much easier with the use of Yolo's object detection functionality, as Yolo essentially supplement my message with on-screen object detection while I continue to elaborate my ideas.

Major drawback so far is the time lag as it is a fairly basic Yolo extension, but still fun enough to put it into practice. Next step I envision is to train customized objects (e.g. by transfer learning) so Yolo is able to pick up additional customized items other than the pre-defined ones.

Feel free to reach out and let me know what you think. I have also linked this repository to my Medium blog https://medium.com/@lafilletterevolution, as I believe sharing of experience is vital to keep the ML community vibrant.

Feel free to fork and enjoy! :)
